             <p>Modern American railways are poorly managed, and run extremely long trains in order to save on costs, at the expense of consistency and reliability.
                 Not only does this make freight rail unappealing for perishable goods, but it also makes it difficult for passenger rails to keep a consistent schedule,
                 as these massive trains cannot use railway sidings. This also leads to inconsistent schedules for workers, as trains don't leave until they reach a certain
                 length, instead of having a consistent schedule.

             <p>
                 Class 1 railways, but particularly Norfolk-Southern, are also known for having a terrible lack of maintinence. A whole train cannot be inspected in 90 seconds, and yet
                 people are expected to do that. There are derailments every few weeks. Really the only good thing I can say is that it's not as bad as it was in the 1970's,
                 when standing derailments where a problem.

         <section id="electrification" class="tableElement">
             <p>
                 US railways are also mostly still running on diesil. Electrification has been an option since the 1930's, and other methods of external traction have existed since
                 the late 1800's (see the atmospheric railway as an example). France has an almost entirely electric system, powered by mass-produced nuclear reactors spread throughout
                 the country. I would advocate for using a similar system, as it would also help with getting off of fossil fuel if we had a few thousand nuclear reactors throughout
                 the country, but I understand a lot of people are still pretty strongly anti-nuclear, and we should be able to power it using renewables, assuming we use some sort
                 of giant batteries. Which have their own problems, look up the lithium triangle for information about that.

            <p>
                The consequences of freight railways being managed this was has also had very negative effects on passenger service. Running a consistent passenger service is impossible
                when a freight train could be anywhere on the railroad, and despite being legally requried to, cannot go into a siding to let a passenger train pass. This, combined with
                overly cut-down infrastructure after the railorad bubble burst in the late 1800's to early 1900's, and then the penn state bankruptcy in 1970, means that passenger service
                is rare and does not work well. This is a big problem for people such as me, who have places to go, but can't or don't want to pay for a car, or just don't know how to
                drive.

         <section id="solution" class="tableElement">
            <p>
                The only solution I can think of is to nationalize all class 1 railroads. Their stagnancy is impressively awful, and they will pay any price to look good for investors,
                as long as it does not involve spending money. A single national system would have numerous benefits.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="solution-computerization" class="tableElement">
            <p>
                A singular, nationalized system will make the railroad far easier to manage. Computers in railroading are about as old as industrial computers, going back to the
                1960's. So adding more computers is not needed. The main benefit to hnaving a unified system is that it can all be centrally managed. This should allow trains to move
                long distances more efficently. New programs will have to be written for this though- the new system will need to take into account worker's pysical and mental health,
                shorter and more frequent trains, and also beeline service.

        <section id="solution-beeline" class="tableElement">
            <p>
                Beeline services are another thing that shoud be looked into. They were experimented with by the Reading company in the mid 1960's, but were not effective due to needing
                to deliver to areas in the penn state system, which was extremely slow and inconsistent. With the beeline service, you could ask for a short,fast train with high priority
                to carry goods to a location. This was intended to compete with trucking, and where it worked, was extremely profitable, despite workers being paid extremely well to get
                them to shut up about it being slightly against union rules.

        <h2>Passenger railroads</h2>
        <p>Passenger railroads also need improvements. Most major cities in the US have metros or els, but intercity rail is severely underdeveloped, and also suburbs are rarely
            connected to the system. We need more highspeed intercity rail to compete with airplanes, as airplanes are both terrible for the environment, and expensive to fly
            on. Ideally, we would build something like the Shinkansen in Japan, which is an extremely reliable and fast high speed rail network, using technology that was allready
            proven at the time it was built. In addition to this, new lines should be built to connect suburbs to cities, to ensure that most people have a good alternative to driving.
        </p>
        <p>
            It would also be very good if this was paired with affordable housing placed near the local rails. Being able to hop on a train to work would be very handy. In order to
            improve efficency further, the trains should be free to ride on. This will make getting onto the trains much faster, as people won't have to stop to pay or show that they
            allready paid in advance. The cost of running the trains would be paid for by the government, likely through increased taxes, and should eventually pay for itself
            as more people are able to get better jobs, and not waste time and energy using cars and getting stuck in traffic jams.
